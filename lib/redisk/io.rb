    # readpartial raises EOFError.

    # When readpartial doesn‘t blocks, it returns or raises immediately. If 
    # the buffer is not empty, it returns the data in the buffer. Otherwise if

    # 
    # If the buffer is not empty, read from the buffer instead of "sysread for 
    # buffered IO (IOError)".
    # It doesn‘t cause Errno::EAGAIN and Errno::EINTR. When readpartial meets 
    # EAGAIN and EINTR by read system call, readpartial retry the system call.
    # The later means that readpartial is nonblocking-flag insensitive. It 
    # blocks on the situation IO#sysread causes Errno::EAGAIN as if the fd is 
    # blocking mode.
