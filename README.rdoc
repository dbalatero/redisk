= redisk

An interface to Redis that mimic's Ruby's IO classes

== WHAT

Redis (http://code.google.com/p/redis/) is a super awesome persisted key-value store.

Why are we still logging to files then?

Redisk is a set of Ruby classes that mimic's Ruby's built in IO classes to allow
drop in replacement for logging and other fun things. 

== USAGE

Currently, Redisk provides two main classes Redisk::IO and Redisk::Logger.

Redisk::IO implements _most_ of the methods of Ruby's IO class (http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/IO.html)

    require 'redisk'
    
    io = Redisk::IO.new('mylog.log') # not a file, a Redis List
    io.puts "Log this!"
    io.gets #=> "Log this!"
    io.gets #=> nil
    io.lineno = 2
    
Its much more interesting to use it with logger.

    logger = Logger.new(Redisk::IO.new('test.log))
    logger.info("Hahah, I'm logging to redis")
    logger.warn("whu?")
    logger.error("zuh")
    
Theres also a nifty wrapper for that behavior:

    logger = Redisk::Logger.new('test.log')
    logger.info "10 less characters!"    

By default, Redisk uses the Redis on localhost:6379, but you can change that by setting

    Redisk.redis = 'myhost:myport'

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
